# ManagEuler

ManagEuler improves the capital efficiency for Euler and other lending protocols through earning yield on unused collateral while maintaining a constant health factor with a keeper.

When you open a position on ManagEuler, the protocol maintains a minimum collateral and buffer health factor on Euler by splitting the value received between collateralization and earning yield.

There are 4 functions to the smart contract:

- Deposit: open a borrowing position on ManagEuler
- Withdraw: close a position on ManagEuler, receiving all deposited funds as well as the yield generated from Sommelier
- Rebalance: rebalance the health factor of a position by changing the collateral amount (and amount earning yield)
- Manage: change the health factor of your position
